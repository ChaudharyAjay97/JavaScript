Que 1: What is React.js? How is it different from other JavaScript frameworks and libraries?

React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive experience.
It mainly focuses on the view layer of an application (in the MVC model - Model, View, Controller).

How it’s different:

Component-Based: React uses reusable components which makes the code more modular and manageable.

Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize rendering, making it faster compared to manipulating the actual browser DOM.

Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows in a single direction (top to bottom), which makes debugging and data handling easier.

Library, not a full framework: Unlike Angular or Vue, React is just the "V" (view) part — you often combine it with other libraries for routing, state management, etc.



Que 2: Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and component-based architecture.

Virtual DOM: React creates a lightweight copy of the real DOM in memory (called the Virtual DOM).When a change happens, React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one (this process is called diffing). Only the differences (or minimal updates) are applied to the real DOM, which makes rendering faster and more efficient.

Component-Based Architecture:

React builds the UI using small, reusable pieces called components. Each component has its own logic, rendering, and state. Components can be nested, managed, and reused to build complex UIs efficiently. This makes applications easier to develop, test, and maintain.


Que 3: What are the advantages of using React.js in web development?

Faster Performance: Virtual DOM makes updating the UI faster and more efficient.
Reusable Components: Saves time and ensures a consistent look and feel across the app.
One-Way Data Binding: Predictable and easier to debug.
Strong Community Support: Tons of libraries, tools, and community help available.
SEO Friendly: React apps can be optimized for search engines with techniques like server-side rendering.
Easy to Learn and Use: Once you understand JavaScript basics, picking up React is straightforward.
Rich Ecosystem: With tools like Redux (for state management), React Router (for routing), and others, you can build powerful applications.
